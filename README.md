# IIITB_Asic
This github repository maps the progress made in the ASIC design class under the guidance of Kunal Ghosh(Founder & CEO Inscopix,Inc). The repository progress as the project proceeds and utilizes the specific tool wherever its needed. Repository will also act as a reference to aspirants who aspire to work in semiconductor industry, all the tools used here are open source and all the necessary instructions are provided wherever its needed.
# Knowing the ASIC
ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Chips, as name suggests these chips are hard coded i.e. made for specific purpose and user can't change its functionality/program as incase of FPGA or Gate Array. These chips are are highly optimised when it comes to the three main aspects of a silicon chip i.e. small area, low power consumption & high performance. But all this comes at a cost hence ASIC chips are costly and using this is only viable when chips are manufactured in large number.
# Day0
Before moving towards the first step of learning the fundamental concepts ASIC design. This section deals with the installation of necessary tools required for the ASIC design.
