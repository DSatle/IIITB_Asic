# IIITB_Asic_Divyam_Satle
This github repository maps the progress made in the ASIC design class under the guidance of Kunal Ghosh(Founder & CEO Inscopix,Inc). The repository progress as the project proceeds and utilizes the specific tool wherever its needed. Repository will also act as a reference to aspirants who aspire to work in semiconductor industry, all the tools used here are open source and all the necessary instructions are provided wherever its needed.
# Knowing the ASIC
ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Chips, as name suggests these chips are hard coded i.e. made for specific purpose and user can't change its functionality/program as incase of FPGA or Gate Array. These chips are are highly optimised when it comes to the three main aspects of a silicon chip i.e. small area, low power consumption & high performance. But all this comes at a cost hence ASIC chips are costly and using this is only viable when chips are manufactured in large number.
# Day_0_Software_Installation
Before moving towards the first step of learning the fundamental concepts ASIC design. This section deals with the installation of necessary tools required for the ASIC design.
## Software Installation
### Yosys
**Steps to install Yosys**
Yosys is a framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Selected features and typical applications:

Process almost any synthesizable Verilog-2005 design
Converting Verilog to BLIF / EDIF/ BTOR / SMT-LIB / simple RTL Verilog / etc.
Built-in formal methods for checking properties and equivalence
Mapping to ASIC standard cell libraries (in Liberty File Format)
Mapping to Xilinx 7-Series and Lattice iCE40 and ECP5 FPGAs
Foundation and/or front-end for custom flows
Yosys can be adapted to perform any synthesis job by combining the existing passes (algorithms) using synthesis scripts and adding additional passes as needed by extending the Yosys C++ code base. Yosys also serves as backend for several tools that use formal methods to reason about designs, such as sby for SMT-solver-based formal property checking or mcy for evaluating the quality of testbenches with mutation coverage metrics. Yosys is free software licensed under the ISC license (a GPL compatible license that is similar in terms to the MIT license or the 2-clause BSD license).
